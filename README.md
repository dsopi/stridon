# stridon

This project is for UCI COMPSCI 125, created by Jessica Shu, Wesley Tsai, and Diellza Sopi.

It is a walk and run recommendation system that will help users get daily exercise by recommending "Strides" (walk or runs)
that the user can go on. We use Google Fit to get the user's fit data, Google Maps to display Stride routes to the user, and Android Calendar to manage when to recommend the user to go on a Stride.
